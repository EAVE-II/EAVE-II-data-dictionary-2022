# :material-slot-machine-outline: Whole Genomic Sequencing

## About
* Rapid sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples and bioinformatic analysis of genome data. This supports the identification of variants and mutants of concern and the detection and investigation of COVID-19 outbreaks and incidents.
* Positive test from PCR test are sent for genomic sequencing to identify the genetic structure of the virus
