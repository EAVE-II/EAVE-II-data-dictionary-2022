This page summarises the recommendations of the key datasets to be used for analysis. For each dataset ( .rds files), meta-data details information about the files and the columns within. Additionally, examples of the formatting of the data in the columns is shown. Dataset Description File(s) Demographics Lookup file for studies within the EAVE-II cohort. This is the most up-to-date dataset that should be used to retrieve a study's Sex, Age, Health Board, Urban/Rural Classifier and SIMD (deprevation). Main Demographics: EAVE_demographics_SK.rds ~5.8 Million Records Vaccinations Records of exposures to COVID-19 vaccines, that includes the dates, doses and vaccine product are given. Additional information such as flags for if the dose was a booster, if the study was shielding etc. are also provided. COVID-19: cleaned_data/C19vaccine_dvprod_cleaned.rds ~12 Million Records Flu: cleaned_data/fluvaccine.rds ~2.1 Million Records QCovid Calculations of QCovid risks for the majority of EAVE-II studies. Individual risks, such asa flag that the study is risk of a severe outcome from COVID-19 due to Diabetes (`Q_DIAG_DIABETES_1`) are provided. Additional information such as a calculation of a study's BMI (`Q_BMI`) is provided QCOVID-2 QCOVID_feb22.rds ~4.3 Million Records Serology Measurements of IgG anti-SARs-CoV-2 spike proteins from individuals attending primary care and individuals who donated blood. Primary Care: serology_primcare_july22_v3.rds ~67 Thousand Records Blood Donors serology_snbts_july22_v3.rds ~46 Thousand Records Severe Cases Observations of severe outcomes and cases (+ve test and/or covid on death certificate). Includes outcomes such as admission to HDU or ICU as well as the number of days from test to admission Deaths and ICU/HDU admissions : cases_severe_dates.rds ~330 Thousand Records Hospitalisations Records taken directly from SMR01 of dates and reason(s) why studies were hospitalised - given by ICD10 codes for conditions. Reasons for hospital admissions : smr01_2022_06_06.rds ~6.4 Million Records Deaths Records of the dates and reasons why death occurred all_deaths.rds ~164 Thousand Records Test Results From the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), testing results for COVID-19 mostly taken from NHS Digital (but also ECOSS and other sources) PCR Test Results : CDW_deduped.rds ~3.9 Million Records LFT Positive Test Results : lft_positives.rds ~0.9 Million Records S-Gene Testing : omicron_ctvals.rds ~0.8 Million Records Sequencing Whole Genomic Sequencing Results from testing data PCR Test Genomic Sequencing : WGS_latest.rds ~350 Thousand Records Prescribing Data Prescribing and Medicines Studies with any monoclonal antibodies (MABs) in their PIS (Prescribing Information System (PIS)) records : PIS_MAB_FLAG_2022-06-08.rds ~5.8 Million Records Hospital Electronic Prescribing and Medicines (HEPMA) therapies administered and prescribed: HEPMA_mABsAVs_admin_ 2022-08-12 .rds HEPMA_mABsAVs_prescr_ 2022-08-12 .rds ~10 (administered) and 5 (prescribed) Thousand Records","title":"Overview"},{"location":"EAVE%20Helpers/","text":"(function() { function addWidgetsRenderer() { var requireJsScript = document.createElement('script'); requireJsScript.src = 'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/require.js/2.3.4/require.min.js'; var mimeElement = document.querySelector('script[type=\"application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json\"]'); var jupyterWidgetsScript = document.createElement('script'); var widgetRendererSrc = 'https://unpkg.com/@jupyter-widgets/html-manager@*/dist/embed-amd.js'; var widgetState; // Fallback for older version: try { widgetState = mimeElement && JSON.parse(mimeElement.innerHTML); if (widgetState && (widgetState.version_major < 2 || !widgetState.version_major)) { widgetRendererSrc = 'jupyter-js-widgets@*/dist/embed.js'; } } catch(e) {} jupyterWidgetsScript.src = widgetRendererSrc; document.body.appendChild(requireJsScript); document.body.appendChild(jupyterWidgetsScript); } document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', addWidgetsRenderer); }()); Install To install the helper package, install remotes and then install directly from GitHub like so: remotes :: install_github ( \"EAVE-II/eavehelpers\" ) Downloading GitHub repo EAVE-II/eavehelpers@HEAD \u2714 checking for file \u2018/private/var/folders/1_/t4xb4ssn55v6wrkx8x5rzkqc0000gn/T/RtmpZROikZ/remotese90735356bd5/EAVE-II-eavehelpers-1bfb2ae/DESCRIPTION\u2019 \u2500 preparing \u2018eavehelpers\u2019: \u2714 checking DESCRIPTION meta-information \u2500 checking for LF line-endings in source and make files and shell scripts \u2500 checking for empty or unneeded directories \u2500 building \u2018eavehelpers_0.0.1.tar.gz\u2019 Installing package into \u2018/usr/local/lib/R/4.2/site-library\u2019 (as \u2018lib\u2019 is unspecified) Data Dictionary Look up labels and descriptions of variables in the EAVE-II datasets: eavehelpers :: get_label ( 'Q_DIAG_COPD' ) 'Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) indicator' eavehelpers :: get_description ( 'Q_DIAG_COPD' ) 'Study marked as at risk of COVID-19 due to Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) indicator' Get the full data dictionary if you want to explore more / lookup more data dd <- eavehelpers :: get_data_dictionary () dd A data.frame: 233 \u00d7 7 | name <chr> | label <chr> | description <chr> | type <chr> | min <chr> | max <chr> | values <list> | |---|---|---|---|---|---|---| | EAVE_LINKNO | EAVE Study Identifier | EAVE-II Identifier, pseudoynmised CHI numbers are used to create randomly assigned study index numbers. | chr | <!----> | <!----> | NULL | | SampleID | Sample ID | Original Sample ID from the serology team | chr | <!----> | <!----> | NULL | | age | Age | Age of the study given in years, extracted from the serology files - and shouldn't be well trusted | dbl | 17 | 84 | 57, 55, 56, 54, 52 | | sex | Sex (number) | Sex at birth - extracted from the serology files/team - it should not be trusted as being reliable | chr | <!----> | <!----> | F, M | | isoweek | Week Number | Week number since the start of the pandemic | dbl | 1 | 53 | 28, 36, 32, 41, 51 | | year | Year | Year of the lookup file used to determine the Health Boards | dbl | 2020 | 2022 | 2021, 2020, 2022 | | Sampledate_iso | Sample Date | The date the serology measurement was taken from the individual (in ISO format) | dttm | <!----> | <!----> | 2021-12-20, 2020-07-02, 2021-12-30, 2020-07-06, 2022-01-14 | | hb | Health Board | The Scottish Health Board in which the individual was registered with | chr | <!----> | <!----> | NHS Lothian , NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, NHS Tayside , NHS Grampian , NHS Lanarkshire | | assay | Assay | Antibody Assay machine was was used when measuring the blood serum sample for the presence of IgG antibodies to SARs-CoV-2 | chr | <!----> | <!----> | Euroimmune, Abbott | | test_result_qual | Qualitative Test Result | Qualitative test results from the assay for the presence (or lack thereof) of IgG to SARs-CoV-2.
